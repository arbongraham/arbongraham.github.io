      <p class="w3-large"><b>Hypothesis / Question:</b></p>
      <p class="w3-large">The teams that have won the Premier League since 2016 will rank at the highest of all these questions (Liverpool, Manchester City 2x, Chelsea). Will there be any outliers in the top 5 from each category?</p>
      <p class="w3-large"><b>Questions to answer the hypothesis / question:</b></p>
      <p class="w3-large">What teams in the premier league have the highest average SPI in their games across the data set?</p>
      <p class="w3-large">What team in the premier league have have the highest probability of winning across the data set?</p>
      <p class="w3-large">What team in the premier league had the highest predicted goal total across the set? </p>
      <p class="w3-large">What was the actual total goals for that team?</p>
      <p class="w3-large"><b>Why did I want to know this?</b></p>
      <p class="w3-large">The reason I wanted to analyze this is I have a personal interest in soccer and wanted to see how teams might compare across these statistics over a four year period.
      I specifically chose the Premier League as that is the league I'm most comfortable with. </p>
      <p class="w3-large"><b>What did I use to analyze the data?</b></p>
      <p class="w3-large">I used 'Numbers' in on Mac to sift through and sort the data I wanted to gather to get the information.</p>
      <p class="w3-large"><b>How did I do this?</b></p>
      <p class="w3-large">The data was obtained from <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/soccer-predictions/">Five Thirty Eight</a> which has gathered data over the past four years and uses ESPN / Five Thirty EIght’s Soccer Power Index as a rating for 
      the teams originally devised by Nate Silver. A link with more detail on how their data was gathered and projected made can be found <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/methodology/how-our-club-soccer-predictions-work/">here</a>.</p>

      <p class="w3-large">The first step was to download a data set, unfortunately this contained over 44,000 values that included scores from leagues all over the world. As is seen in those alone it contains data from leagues that I don't want so it became necessary to filter those out.</p>
      <p class="w3-large">The images on the right show the data sets with the first 10 items and last 10 items with the column I used for my initial filter highlighted. My following step was to narrow this down to only the premier league and I did this just by filtering by “league_id”. </p>

    <div class="w3-col m6 w3-padding-large">
      <p class="w3-large">The Premier League id was 2411, so after my initial filter my data set looked as shown as the left; however, this still had a lot of information that I didn't need to answer my questions so the next step was to prune the remaining data.</p>
      <p class="w3-large">The lower portion of the image shows the final pruned data set to where I can start analyzing the values I need to answer my questions.</p>
    </div>


  <div class="w3-row w3-padding-large"> 
      <p class="w3-large">The next part involved making an entirely new sheet with a line for each team. Each team would have spi1 and sppi2 value, proj_score1 and proj_score2 value, score1 and score2 value. It would also include a count for first column and second columns, we need this for averages. From my pruned data set I will then sift through and collect data for each column associated with each team.</p>
